# Lootcrawler 3.3.5a
This very simple lootcrawler is made to read the contents of a logs file containing items distributed to players through loot council. It can be connected to directly upload
loot council awards to google sheets, or to text files.

## Prerequisites
To utilise the addon best, the following must be set up:
* [WowScribe v. 3.3.1](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/wowscribe/files/400551)
* Google API enabled google sheets worksheet

## Setup
#### Google sheets
*I recommend following John Whatson Ronney's guide [Here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ct0xvw_Z0tU) on how to set up. Just follow this until around 2:31*
